# Serhan Aya 2016-07-02.

# This is a subsection for Part 3: Exploratory Analysis. In this
# section the explorations are focused on the following questions:
# Q7  : Which virus has the highest impact?
# Q8  : What is the most infective virus amongst others?
# Q9  : Which virus has the longest lifetime?
# Q10  : How long has these viruses are around/ and known that they
#       are around (i.e. they are documented)?
# Q11 : How many of those viruses are relatively inactive?
# Q12 : Which viruses update the most, as well as the least?
